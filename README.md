# Welcome to the [Fifty List](https://fiftylist.vercel.app/) Project.

IMPORTANT: This project is under maintenance.

This project is a music automation platform and is featured within my portfolio at ivanluna.dev. It showcases a seamless integration of React and Python. For detailed insights, please visit [this link](https://ivanluna.dev/projects/post-reactpython-fiftylist/).

## Demo

## Key Features

### Frontend (React.js)
- Spotify Integration: Fetches your top 50 tracks from Spotify within a chosen timeframe (1, 6 months, or all-time classics).

### Backend (Python)
- Flask-Powered: Acts as a middleware that interfaces with React.
- Fifty Card: Organizes retrieved tracks dynamically into a static brand new website in order to provide sharing functionality to social media or for accessing later, including artist names, song titles, album names, release dates, and genres.

## About the Project

FiftyList is an exploratory project diving deep into the collaboration of different programming languages and APIs. It is designed to:
- Demonstrate Seamless Communication: Showcases smooth communication between the frontend and backend using API calls.
- Emphasize Language Synergy: Highlights the synergy between React's frontend prowess and Python's backend efficiency.
- Data Presentation Challenge: Ensures that complex data is rendered in a user-friendly format and transmitted effectively between systems.

## Installation and Usage

### For Frontend Installation:
1. Clone this project.
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/imprvhub/fiftylist-react.git
```
In your IDE terminal:
1.2 Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd /your/folder/directory/fiftylist-react
```
3. Run the command `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
4. Replace the environment variables (`REACT_APP_SCOPES`, `REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI`, `REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`) with your own. You can generate these variables from Spotify Developer Dashboard.
5. Replace the variable defined at the beginning of the code in `App.js`:
   `const redirectUri = 'https://fiftylist.vercel.app/callback';` with -> `const redirectUri = "http://localhost:3000/callback";`
   Update the URLs in the variables of the `exportShare` function from `'https://fiftylistbackend.vercel.app/share'` to `'http://localhost:5000/share'` if your Python backend is using a different 
   port.
6. Run `npm start` from your IDE terminal; this should start the frontend on the designated port. Repeat the process for the backend.

### For Backend Installation:
### Prerequisites:
[**Python 3.11**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

1. Clone the project. ( https://github.com/imprvhub/fiftylist-python )
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/imprvhub/fiftylist-python.git
```
In your IDE terminal:
1.2 Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd /your/folder/directory/fiftylist-python
```
2. Run the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies.
3. Replace the variable defined at the beginning of the share.py code: `cors = CORS(app, resources={r"/share": {"origins": "https://fiftylist-frontend.vercel.app/"}})` with ->  `cors = CORS(app, resources={r"/share": {"origins": "http://localhost:3000/"}})` (or the port you designated for your frontend).
4. Run `python3 share.py`.
   
IMPORTANT: Open two separate windows in your IDE to run the fullstack locally. Execute the commands to have both projects running simultaneously for them to work seamlessly.
