                <p>Once you authenticate yourself (either with the demo account or your personal account), please note that, for the results obtained to be reflected in all chosen options, the account (whether free or premium) must have significant listening time of more than 6 months.</p>
                <p>If you have an account with more than 6 months of listening time, the web application will retrieve more complete results, and the recommendation engine will be broader.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>As indicated in the following instructions, you first need to press the "1. Select Time Period:" button.</p>
                <img src="/images/guides/step1.png" alt="guide1" style="width: 70%; height: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
                <p>Here you will select between one month, 6 months, or all time.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Then press the "2. Get 50 most listened tracks" button.</p> 
                <img src="/images/guides/step2.png" alt="guide2" style="width: 60%; height: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
                <p>This button will display the results directly in the same tab, organizing the top 50 songs listened to by you in that time period. In the end, 20 new recommendations based on those first 50 results will be shown.</p>
                <hr>
                <img src="/images/guides/step3.png" alt="guide3" style="width: 60%; height: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">  
                <p>If you want to navigate to a specific song, artist, or album, simply click on them, here the pointer is placed over the artist's name and by clicking on it, a new tab (in Spotify) will open with that information. (Applicable also for song or album)</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Finally, you can:</p>
                <img src="/images/guides/step4.png" alt="guide4" style="width: 60%; height: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; border-radius: 15px;">   
                <p>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generate a Fifty Card (This will generate a static website for you or your contacts to access those obtained results. This functionality also allows sharing to your social networks with a unique link).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>And lastly, "Revoke access" provides a step-by-step guide on how to revoke our access to your Spotify account.</p>

                    <h3>About the granted access.</h3>
                    <p>Spotify imposes a limit of 25 free users that must be added by the developer. These users can then use the web application. To open the web application to the general public, an extension of quota must be requested. The application currently has not extended the quota, as the purpose of this web application is merely demonstrative, allowing users to test its technical functionality.</p>
                    <p>When prompted to add your personal Spotify account during the introductory authentication screen, it is to include that email in the 25 trial users provided by Spotify without a quota extension.</p>
                    <p>To provide you with a personalized experience, this service will require (if you are not using our provided demo account) permissions to access your Spotify account (with your explicit consent only). For more information, review the <a class="highlight" href="/html/privacypolicy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a> and the <a class="highlight" href="/html/termsandconditions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terms of Use.</a></p> If you wish to grant access to your personal Spotify account or have any other questions or concerns, please contact <a class="highlight" href="mailto:contact@ivanluna.dev" rel="noopener">contact@ivanluna.dev.</a></p>
